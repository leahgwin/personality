        <h3>A Glance Into the Life of an ESTP</h3>
        <p>
            ESTPs keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is – or better
            yet, to just go out and do it. Entrepreneurs leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, rather
            than sitting idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Entrepreneurs are full of passion and energy, complemented by a rational, if sometimes distracted, mind. Inspiring, convincing
            and colorful, they are natural group leaders, pulling everyone along the path less traveled, bringing life and
            excitement everywhere they go. Putting these qualities to a constructive and rewarding end is Entrepreneurs’
            true challenge.
